/**
 * Not implemented! This class would ideally like to map out objects of interest
 * as picked up by the ultrasonic sensors during navigation. The purpose of the
 * {@link hardwareAbstraction.UltrasonicMotor} functionality would be to map out
 * objects as the robot is navigating. This would interact with the
 * {@link Navigation} class to add points to the route. Due to time constraints,
 * there was not a considerable amount of work done on this topic.
